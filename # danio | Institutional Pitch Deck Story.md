# danio | Institutional Pitch Deck Storyboard

## part 0: start (landing page)
narrartor: here is my demo for danio: a tool for bridging the gap between unstructured legal prose and structured credit data

## part 1: continue (credit ledger but move to reader.html)
Narrator: "Institutional credit is governed by complex legal agreements, yet managed via manual data entry. This gap between legal intent and operational data creates settlement delays, manual errors, and a total lack of portfolio-wide transparency."

## Part 2 : THE Credit LEDGER 
Narrator: "The Credit Ledger provides asset-level transparency across the entire portfolio. By digitizing loan agreement information, danio transforms a static legal document into a dynamic digital asset ."

## part 3: THE NORMALIZATION PIPELINE 
Visual: The Normalizer UI (reader.html). We see the system actively identifying specific terms (e.g., Maturity Date, Applicable Margin) within the Credit Agreement.
Narrator: "danio bridges the gap. The document intelligence system translates bespoke legal prose into a unified data structure. We transform static documents into active, machine-readable digital assets."
Narrator: "Every agreement becomes a Standardized Loan Object (SLO). This is a single source of truth for every facility attribute—ready for immediate integration into risk, accounting, and reporting systems."

danio | Institutional Credit Agreement Standardization

danio is a tool to help reduce operational bottlenecks in syndicated lending. It bridges the gap between unstructured legal prose and structured credit data, facilitating transparency and straight-through processing across the loan lifecycle.

The Problem: Operational Friction

The syndicated loan market is hindered by "dark data" trapped within complex legal agreements. Manual extraction of commercial terms is slow, prone to error, and prevents real-time portfolio analysis. This lack of standardization leads to settlement delays and inconsistent risk monitoring.

The Solution: danio

danio provides a smart system that harmonizes credit agreements into a standardized System. By aligning bespoke financial covenants and economic terms, danio transforms a static legal document into a dynamic digital asset.

Key Features

1. Credit Term Harmonization

Resolves discrepancies between bespoke legal phrasing and internal accounting systems. The platform aligns diverse commercial terms—such as interest rate step-downs and margin grids—into a unified framework for portfolio-wide consistency.

2. Standardized Loan Object (SLO)

A proprietary framework that provides a definitive digital record of every credit instrument. The SLO enables seamless integration with risk engines and straight-through processing, ensuring that the legal "code" of the agreement is interoperable with financial systems.

3. Operational Transparency

Mitigates settlement delays by providing immediate access to critical data. Instantly verify financial covenants, leverage ratios, and maturity profiles to ensure accurate capital allocation and compliance monitoring.
